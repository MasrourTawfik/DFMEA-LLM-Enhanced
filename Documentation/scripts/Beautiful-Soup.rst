Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping purposes. It provides a convenient way to parse HTML and XML documents, extract data, and navigate through the document structure.

- `parent`: Access the parent tag of a given tag.
- `children`: Access the direct children of a given tag.

Extracting Data

Once you have located the desired elements in the document, you can extract data from them using various methods and attributes provided by Beautiful Soup. Here are a few examples:

- `text`: Get the text content of a tag.
- `get`: Get the value of a specific attribute of a tag.
- `find_next_sibling`: Find the next sibling tag of a given tag.
